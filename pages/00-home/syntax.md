The rules of the syntax are listed and described in the **MDE's specification**, which is 
the *big work* of this site. We write and maintain the [MDE manifest](02-manifest.html)
for this purpose.

A quick documentation is proposed in the [cheat sheet](03-cheat-sheet.html) with all
rules in one page for a day-to-day usage.
