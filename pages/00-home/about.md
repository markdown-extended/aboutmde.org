**Markdown** is a set of writing rules to build some human readable text contents, such as `.txt` common files, which can be parsed to build some HTML valid content, structurally and typographically. The first idea was from [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/), coded in *Perl* script.

**Markdown** has become one of the most common standards of rich-text contents, used for example by [GitHub](http://github.com) as one of the proposed syntaxes for informational files.
