**Markdown** is a set of writing rules created by [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/)
to build some human readable text contents, such as `.txt` common files, which can be
parsed to build some HTML valid content, structurally and typographically.

**Markdown** has become one of the most common standards of rich-text contents,
used for example by [GitHub](http://github.com) as one of the proposed syntaxes for
informational files.

**Markdown Extended** is a complete review of the syntax rules used around the web and 
intend to be the new reference for Markdown.
