About MDE
=========

**Markdown Extended** is a descendant of the original **Markdown** idea from 
[John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/). The *extended* version tries to propose 
a complete set of Markdown syntax tags and rules and to be a **reference** for
users and developers who wants to use or implement the Markdown syntax.


## What is Markdown?

Created by [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) in 2004, 
**Markdown** is, as he says:

>    a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you 
>    to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it 
>    to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

As I would say, **Markdown** is a set of writing rules to build some human readable text 
contents, such as `.txt` common files, which can be parsed to build some reach and interactive
content, structurally and typographically.

This syntax has become one of the most common standards of rich-text contents, used for
instance by [GitHub](http://github.com) as one of the proposed syntaxes for informational
files (such like this one).


### A short history

The original Markdown idea and the very first parser was made by
[John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/), coded in *Perl* script.

An extended implementation, known as **Markdown Extra**, has been written by
[Michel Fortin](http://michelf.com/), coded in *PHP* script.

Another extended implementation, known as **Multi Markdown**, has been written by 
[Fletcher T. Penney](http://fletcherpenney.net/), coded in *Perl* script.

### So why a new version of the syntax?

Well, many other implementations exists for the syntax, with their own rules and tags. This is
the reason why we try here to build a kind of *universal version* of the Markdown rules (which are
quite *not*-universal along the web). The real work is the [Manifest](02-manifest.html) which
is a kind of **un-official specifications** written with rigor and strictness to finally
be a set of "rule for any purpose".
